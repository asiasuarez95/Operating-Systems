So for this lab, I chose to program using Java. So it should be able to be complied using the traditional javac call.
LinkerHW.java contains the main program. ModuleHW and variables.java are additional classes to store relavent information. 
I chose to prompt the user to input the modules as a standard input ie using Scanner, so once prompted, simply copy in the correct inputs.
The program then prints to the terminal the following results. 


Special Instructions:
	I also actually used an external jar, that can be found on https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/download_lang.cgi.
	Specicically I dowloaded the source file commons-lang3-3.4-src.zip and from this file I imported the external jar: commons-lang3-3.4.jar 
	into my eclipse project.
